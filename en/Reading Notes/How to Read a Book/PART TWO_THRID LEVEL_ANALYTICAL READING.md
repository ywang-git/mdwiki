# 6. PIGEONHOLING A BOOK
## The Importance of Classifying Books
__RULE 1: YOU MUST KNOW WHAT KIND OF BOOK YOU ARE READING, AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS AS EARLY IN THE PROCESS AS POSSIBLE, PREFERABLY BEFORE YOU BEGIN TO READ.__

give it an inspecional reading

## What You can Learn from the Title of a Book
know what that kind is

* fiction
* expository
  * history
  * phylosophy, etc.

## Practical vs. Theorotical Books

pure science / applied science

science / technology

what is the case
  => what to do about it if we wish to get somewhere

(knowing that => knowing how)

practical book: tells you should do / how to do 
guide book: expositions of arts to be learned
engineering, medicine, cooking
treatiese: moral, economic, entical, political problems
an oration: a political speech / moral exhortation

difference between 

* a political harangue and a treatise on politics
* economic propaganda and a analysis of economic problems

questions about the validity of someting -> theorotical
to raise questions about the end of anything -> practical

pratical book: should / ought / good / bad / ends / means

theorotical book: is

## Kinds of Theorotical Books
history / science / philosophy

* history: chronotopic - always deals with things that existed or events that ooccurred on a particular date & in a particular place
* science: laws / generalizations
* philosophy: general truths, different method with science
* science: emphasizing things outside the scope of normal, routine, daily life
* phlosophy: normal and common experience for the verification or support of anything the writer has to say


# 7 X-RAYING A BOOK
__RULE 2: STATE THE UNITY OF THE WHOLE BOOK IN A SINGLE SENTENCE, OR AT MOST A FEW SENTENCES (A SHORT PARAGRAPH).__ to discover its theme main point apprehend the unity with definiteness -> express

__RULE 3: SET FORTH THE MAJOR PARTS OF THE BOOK, AND SHOW HOW THESE ARE ORGANIZED INTO A WHOLE. BY BEING ORDERED TO ONE ANOTHER AND TO THE UNITY OF THE WHOLE.__
 
## Of Plots and Plans: Stating the Unity of a Book
the mark of every good story, novel or play:

* a main thread of plot
* a single unity of action

ties everything together 
--Aristotle, Poetics

title may help find out the unity of a ???

* how frequently you can expect the author help you to state the plan of his book
* a unity can be variously stated

## Mastering the Multiplicity: The Art of Outlining a Book

treating the parts as if they were subordinate wholes, each with a unity and complexity of its own.

formular:

1. The author accomplished this plan in five major parts, of which the first part is about .... fifth part ...
2. The first of these major parts is divided into three sections, of which the first considers X, ... the third considers ...
3. In the first section of the first part, the author makes four points, of which the first is A, ... the fourth is ...

these rules can be followed "approximatedly" for only a relatively few books
do not rely on chapter headings and sectional divisions passively

find how and why the main theme is stated as is by discovering the real structure

## The Reciprocal Arts of Reading and Writing
reciprocal rules followed in different ways

reader uncover ->

book skeleton     book

author cover up <-

A peice of wrting should have unity, clarity and cohenerence (the distinction and the order of the parts).

THESE THREE RULES:

* can be used to distinguish well made books from badly made ones.
* can be used in reading any substantial part of an expository books, as well as the whole

## Discovering the Author's Intentions
__RULE 4: FIND OUT WHAT THE AUTHOR'S PROBLEMS WERE.__

state the main question that the book tries to answer / state the subordinate questions if the main question is complex and has many parts put questions in an inteeligible order

intentional fallacy: fallacy of thinking you can discover what was in an author's mind from the book he has written

kinds of questions anyone can ask about anything: 

* does something exist?
* what kind of thing is it?
* what caused it to exist or under what conditions can it exist or why does it exist?
* what purpose does it serve?
* what are the consequences of its existence?
* what are its characteristic properties, its typical traits?
* what are its relations to other things of a similiar sort, or of a different sorts?
* how does it behave?

THESE ARE ALL THEOROTICAL QUESTIONS

* what ends should be sought?
* what means should be chosen to a given end?
* what things must one do to gain a certain objective and in what order?
* under these conditions, what is the right thing to do, or the better rather to do this rather than that?

THESE ARE ALL PRACTICAL QUESTIONS

## The First Stage of Analytical Reading
4 rules, 1 aim:

provide the reader with a knowledge of a book's structure

The First Stage of Analytical Reading or Rules for finding What a Book is About

1. Classify the book according to kind and subject matter
2. State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity
3. Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole
4. Define the problem or problems the authors is trying to solve

# 8. COMING TO TERMS WITH AN AUTHOR
coming to terms: first step beyond the outline a term is the basic element of communicable knowledge

Words vs. Terms

communication: an effort on the part of one person to share something with another person, his knowledge, decisions, sentiments

same words with the same meaning -- come to terms

a term: a word used unambiguously

terms: occur only in the process of communication

: a skilled use of words for the sake of communicating knowledge

(about expository writers & books)

__RULE 5: FIND THE IMPORTANT WORDS AND THROUGH THEM COME TO TERMS WITH THE AUTHOR.__

two steps (some as other rules in stage 2)

1. dealing with the language as such
2. beyond the language to be the thought that lies behind it

(Leibniz: scheme for an ideal language)

No author, regardless of his skill in writing, can achieve communication without a reciprocal skill on the part of readers

1. grammatical aspect: deals with words
2. logical step: deals with their meanings terms

## Finding the Key Words
an author uses most words as men ordinarily do in conversation, with a range of meanings, and trusting to the context to indicate the shifts.

the most important words are those that give you trouble

## Technical Words and Special Vocabularies
1. the explicit stress an author places upon certain words and not others
  * typographical devices: quotation marks, italics
  * explicitly discussing its various senses and indicating the way he is going to use it here and there
  * emphasize the word by defining the thing that the word is used to name

  Every field of knowledge has its own technical vocabulary.

2. the reader may locate the words through having some prior knowledge of the subject matter: spot them positively through having some acquaintance with the field, or negatively by kowing what words must be technical. because they are not ordinary

  philosophers - "make it a technical word" 
  
3. the author qurrels with other writers about it

## Finding the Meaning
two main possibility's (after finding the key words)

1. the author is using these words in a single sense throughout
2. he is using them in two or more senses, shifting his meaning from place to place

procedure

1. try to determine whether the word has one or many meanings
2. if it has many, try to see how they are related
3. note the places where the word is used in one sense or another, and see if the context gives you any clue to the reason for the shift in meanings

you have to discover the meaning of a word you do not understand by using the meaning of all the other words in the context that you do understand.

easiest way - consider a definition operate meanings you already possess (with context)

trial-and-error method

a word in place is a term

no idealy perfect book

one word can represent several terms

distinguish between author's vocabulary and his terminology

several further complications:

1. a word that has several distinct meanings can be used either in a single sense or in a combination of senses (if several meanings are related, one can use a word to stand for all of them, for some of them, or for only one of them at a time So long as each usage is definite, the word so used is a term
2. synonyms. one and the same term is represented by two or more words used synoynmously (on the one hand, a single word maybe related to several terms: on the other hand, a single term may be related to several words)
3. phrases. a term can be expressed by a phrase as well as by a word (a phrase is less likely to be ambiguious

literal & metaphorical use of words

abstract & concrete words

proper & common names

defining words & defining things

indefiniable words with definite meanings

emotive use of words v.s. communication of knowledge


ordinary "motional" speech v.s. "bizarre" or "crazy" talk

# 9. DETERMINING AN AUTHOR'S MESSAGE

making propositions: sort of proposal (offer / acceptance)

requirement: honest, clear, attractive

proposition: a declaration on expression of the author's judgement about something. declaration of knowledge, not intention

order of reading reverse the order of business

terms -> preposition

authro's prepositions are nothing but expressions of personal opinion unless they are supported by reasons

preposition -> why he think we should be persuaded to accept them

every sort of argument consists of a number of statements related in a ceratin way

argument key words:

if / then, since / therefore follows

an argument: a set or series of statements of which some provide the grounds or reasons for what is to be concluded

a paragraph, a collection of sentences, to express an argument

the premises or principles of an argument: are the source of conclusion

if the argument is valid, the conclusion follows from the premises

(false premises => false conclusions)

grammatical:

words/phrases => sentences => collection of sentences
terms => propositions => arguments

outlining

              =>  level of proposition & arguments                
interpretation 


## Sentences v.s. Propositions

not every sentence expresses a proposition

proposition: answer to question, declarations of knowledge or opinion

sentence: declarative v.s. interrogative

not all the declarative sentences can be read as if each expressed one prposition

1. word is ambiguous, shift in terms result in different proposition
2. a compound sentence expresses two or more propositions

some proposition can also be exressed by two or more different sentences.

__RULE 6: MARK THE MOST IMPORTANT SENTENCES IN A BOOK AND DISCOVER THE PROPOSITIONS THEY CONTAIN.__

__RULE 7: LOCATE OR CONSTRUCT THE BASIC ARGUMENTS IN THE BOOK BY FINDING THEM IN THE CONNECTION OF SENTENCES.__

## Finding the Key Sentences

understand every sentence
