# 1. THE ACTIVITY AND ART OF READING
 stage: first grade
* thrid stage: knowledge -> understanding (we donâ€™t have to know everything about something in order to understand it)

## Active Reading
better:

1. reading more actively
2. performing each of the acts involved more skillfully

## The Goals of Reading: Reading for information and Reading for Understanding
the art of reading (pp8)
> the process whereby a mind, with nothing operate on but the symbols of the readable matter, and with no help from outside, elevates itself by the power of its own operations.

conditions of reading for understanding:
1. initial inequality in understanding
2. ability to overcome this inequality

## Reading as Learning: The Difference Between Learning by Discovery
* learning by instruction: instruction -> aided discovery
* learning by discovery
  * unaided discovery: the art of reading, nature, or the world
  * aided discovery: the art of reading books, to learn / listen from discourse
skills:
* keenness of observation
* readily available memory
* range of imagination
* an intellect trained in analysis & reflection

## Present and Absent Teachers
answer the question yourself

# 2. THE LEVELS OF READING
* elementary reading:
  * words -> meaning
* inspectional reading:
  * emphasis on time
  * get the most out of a book within a given time

* analytica reading:
  * thorough reading
  * preeminently for the sake of understanding
  * syntopical reading: an analysis of the subject that may not be in any of the books

# 3. THE FIRST LEVEL OF READING: ELEMENTARY READING
teaching of reading
* ABC method (synthetic)
* phonic method
* sight method
* ecletic approach

## Stages of Learning to Read
1. reading readiness
  * physical: good vision & hearing
  * intellectual: visual perception
  * language: speak clearly, sentence order
  * personal: work with others, sustain attention, follow directions
2. simple materials
  * 200 - 300 words
  * basic skills: use of context / meaning clues & beginning sounds of words
3. vocabulary building & increasing skill by "unlocking" the meaning of unfamiliar words through context clues
  read for different purposes, in different areas
4. refinement & enhancement

## Stages and Levels
four stages of elementary level:
* first stage: preschool & kindergarten
* second stage: first grade
* third stage: end of fourth grade
* four stage: 8th / 9th / 10th grade

## Higher Levels of Reading & Higher Education
One should not have to spend 20 years to learn how to read
## Reading and the Democratic Ideal of Education

# 4. THE SECOND LEVEL OF READING: INSPECTIONAL READING
two types of inspectional reading:
## Inspectional Reading 1: Systematic Skimming or Pre-reading
* whether it deserves an analytial reading
* limited time

skim / pre-read goal: 

1. descover whether the book requires a more careful reading
2. tells you lots of other things about the book author's main contention

  what kind of book he has written
  1. Look at the title page and, if the book has one, at its preface

  		read quickly, subtitles / other indications of the scope or aim of the book or of the author's special angle or his subject categorize / pigeonhole
  2. Study the table of contents

      obtain a general sense of the book's structure
  3. Check the index

      a quick estimates of the range of topics covered & of the kinds of books and authors referred to
      
      look up some passages cited for crucial terms (crux / new departure)
  4. Read the Publisher's Blub

      may contain the main points in the book put aside for the moment
  5. Look Now at the Chapters that Seem to be Pivotal to its Argument

      read sumary statements in opening / closing pages carefully
  6. Turn the Pages, Dipping in Here and There, Reading a Paragraph or Two, Sometimes Several Pages in Sequence, Never more than that
      
      thumb through, looking for signs of the main contention. do not fail to read the last two / three pages, or epilogue
      
active reading / be alert

## Inspectional Reading II: Superficial Reading
mistake: expecting too much from the first going over of a difficult book

right approach: rule of reading

In tackling a difficult book for the first time, read it through without ever stopping to look up or ponder the things you do not understand right away.

Concentrate on the things you do understand. keep reading, read through once, better chance of understanding on second read

## On Reading Speed
vary rate of reading in accordance with the nature and complexity of the material.

* inspectional reading: read fast, less, with different golas
* analytical reading: do not read all of it at the same speed

## Fixations and Regressions
eye moving speed v.s. mind understanding

## The Problem of Comprehension
concentration improves
define comprehension at levels beyond the elementary

## Summary of Inspectional Reading
Every book should be read no more slowly than it deserves, and no more quickly than you can read it with satisfaction and comprehension.

* first stage (systematic skimming) - serves to prepare the analytical reader to answer the questions that must be asked during the first stage of that level: anticipates the comprehension of a book's structure
* second stage (superficial reading) - the first necessary step in the interpretation of a book's contents

# 5. HOW TO BE A DEMANDING READER
## The Essence of Active Reading: The Four Basic Questions a Reader Asks

Ask questions while you read - questions that you yourself must try to answer in the course of reading.

1. WHAT IS THE BOOK IS ABOUT AS A WHOLE?

  discover the leading theme, how the author develops this theme in an orderly way by subdividing it into its essential subordinate themes or topics
2. WHAT IS BEING SAID, AND HOW?

  discover the main ideas, assertions, and arguments
3. IS THE BOOK TRUE, IN HOW OR IN PART?
  
  know what is siad -> understand -> decide
4. WHAT OF IT?

  significance of the info why author thinks it is important? what else to follow? further enlightment?
  
## How to Make a Book Your Own
marking a book:
1. keeps you awake
2. reading -> thinking -> express itself in words
3. help remember

devices:

1. UNDERLINING - of major poins, important / forceful statements
2. VERTICLE LINES AT THE MARGIN - to emphasize a statement already underlined or to a passage too long to be underlined
3. STAR, ASTERISK OR OTHER DOODAD AT THE MARGIN (sparingly) to emphasize the ten or dozen most important statements or passages in the book
4. NUMBERS IN THE MARGIN - indicate a sequence of points made by the author in developing an argument
5. NUMBERS OF OTHER PAGES IN THE MARGIN - indicate where else in the book the author makes the same points or points relevant to or in contradiction of those here marked; to tie up the ideas in a book, which though they may be seperated by many pages, belong together (Cf: "compare" .. "refer to")
6. CIRCLING OF KEYWORDS OR PHRASES - same function as underlining
7. WRITING IN THE MARGIN, OR AT THE TOP OR BOTTOM OF THE PAGE - to record the sequence of major points right through the book. personal inex of author's point. a record of your thinkin. out line the book as an integrated structure

## The Three Kinds of Note-making
questions answered by inspectional readings:

1. what kind of book is it?
2. what is it about as a whole?
3. what is the structural order of the work whereby the author develops his conception or understanding of that general subject matter?

* structural note making (on the content page)
* conceptual note making: give answers to questions about the truth and significance of the book
* dialectical note making: shape of the discussion, the discussion that is engaged in by all the authors

## Forming the Habit of Reading
rules -> follow -> habit -> art

## From Many Rules to One Habit
practice as separate acts
-> one goal
thinking about one's own thoughts
