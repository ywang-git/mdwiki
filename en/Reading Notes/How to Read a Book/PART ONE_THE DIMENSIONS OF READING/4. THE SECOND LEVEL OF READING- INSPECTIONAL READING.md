# 4. THE SECOND LEVEL OF READING: INSPECTIONAL READING
two types of inspectional reading:
## Inspectional Reading 1: Systematic Skimming or Pre-reading
* whether it deserves an analytial reading
* limited time

skim / pre-read goal:

1. descover whether the book requires a more careful reading
2. tells you lots of other things about the book author's main contention

  what kind of book he has written
  1. Look at the title page and, if the book has one, at its preface

  		read quickly, subtitles / other indications of the scope or aim of the book or of the author's special angle or his subject categorize / pigeonhole
  2. Study the table of contents

      obtain a general sense of the book's structure
  3. Check the index

      a quick estimates of the range of topics covered & of the kinds of books and authors referred to

      look up some passages cited for crucial terms (crux / new departure)
  4. Read the Publisher's Blub

      may contain the main points in the book put aside for the moment
  5. Look Now at the Chapters that Seem to be Pivotal to its Argument

      read sumary statements in opening / closing pages carefully
  6. Turn the Pages, Dipping in Here and There, Reading a Paragraph or Two, Sometimes Several Pages in Sequence, Never more than that

      thumb through, looking for signs of the main contention. do not fail to read the last two / three pages, or epilogue

active reading / be alert

## Inspectional Reading II: Superficial Reading
mistake: expecting too much from the first going over of a difficult book

right approach: rule of reading

In tackling a difficult book for the first time, read it through without ever stopping to look up or ponder the things you do not understand right away.

Concentrate on the things you do understand. keep reading, read through once, better chance of understanding on second read

## On Reading Speed
vary rate of reading in accordance with the nature and complexity of the material.

* inspectional reading: read fast, less, with different golas
* analytical reading: do not read all of it at the same speed

## Fixations and Regressions
eye moving speed v.s. mind understanding

## The Problem of Comprehension
concentration improves
define comprehension at levels beyond the elementary

## Summary of Inspectional Reading
Every book should be read no more slowly than it deserves, and no more quickly than you can read it with satisfaction and comprehension.

* first stage (systematic skimming) - serves to prepare the analytical reader to answer the questions that must be asked during the first stage of that level: anticipates the comprehension of a book's structure
* second stage (superficial reading) - the first necessary step in the interpretation of a book's contents
