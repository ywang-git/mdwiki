# 8. COMING TO TERMS WITH AN AUTHOR
coming to terms: first step beyond the outline a term is the basic element of communicable knowledge

Words vs. Terms

communication: an effort on the part of one person to share something with another person, his knowledge, decisions, sentiments

same words with the same meaning -- come to terms

a term: a word used unambiguously

terms: occur only in the process of communication

: a skilled use of words for the sake of communicating knowledge

(about expository writers & books)

__RULE 5: FIND THE IMPORTANT WORDS AND THROUGH THEM COME TO TERMS WITH THE AUTHOR.__

two steps (some as other rules in stage 2)

1. dealing with the language as such
2. beyond the language to be the thought that lies behind it

(Leibniz: scheme for an ideal language)

No author, regardless of his skill in writing, can achieve communication without a reciprocal skill on the part of readers

1. grammatical aspect: deals with words
2. logical step: deals with their meanings terms

## Finding the Key Words
an author uses most words as men ordinarily do in conversation, with a range of meanings, and trusting to the context to indicate the shifts.

the most important words are those that give you trouble

## Technical Words and Special Vocabularies
1. the explicit stress an author places upon certain words and not others
  * typographical devices: quotation marks, italics
  * explicitly discussing its various senses and indicating the way he is going to use it here and there
  * emphasize the word by defining the thing that the word is used to name

  Every field of knowledge has its own technical vocabulary.

2. the reader may locate the words through having some prior knowledge of the subject matter: spot them positively through having some acquaintance with the field, or negatively by kowing what words must be technical. because they are not ordinary

  philosophers - "make it a technical word"

3. the author qurrels with other writers about it

## Finding the Meaning
two main possibility's (after finding the key words)

1. the author is using these words in a single sense throughout
2. he is using them in two or more senses, shifting his meaning from place to place

procedure

1. try to determine whether the word has one or many meanings
2. if it has many, try to see how they are related
3. note the places where the word is used in one sense or another, and see if the context gives you any clue to the reason for the shift in meanings

you have to discover the meaning of a word you do not understand by using the meaning of all the other words in the context that you do understand.

easiest way - consider a definition operate meanings you already possess (with context)

trial-and-error method

a word in place is a term

no idealy perfect book

one word can represent several terms

distinguish between author's vocabulary and his terminology

several further complications:

1. a word that has several distinct meanings can be used either in a single sense or in a combination of senses (if several meanings are related, one can use a word to stand for all of them, for some of them, or for only one of them at a time So long as each usage is definite, the word so used is a term
2. synonyms. one and the same term is represented by two or more words used synoynmously (on the one hand, a single word maybe related to several terms: on the other hand, a single term may be related to several words)
3. phrases. a term can be expressed by a phrase as well as by a word (a phrase is less likely to be ambiguious

literal & metaphorical use of words

abstract & concrete words

proper & common names

defining words & defining things

indefiniable words with definite meanings

emotive use of words v.s. communication of knowledge


ordinary "motional" speech v.s. "bizarre" or "crazy" talk
