financial information

  - **The 10-K** (most recent): annually, financials (insider stock holdings, brief biographies of the management team)
  - **The 10-Q** (most recent): three times a year (quarterly)
  - **Press releases** (all recent ones)
  - **Analysts' reports** (any available up-to-date ones)

### Learn about the company
first thing: mission, products, attitude, prospects

three main financial statements:

- **the Income Statement (or Statement of Operations)**: how much money the company made over the last year and its profit margin
- **Balance Sheet**: how much cash, inventories and debt the company has
- **the Statement of Cash Flows**: how much money the company is really making as it works through operations, makes investments, and borrows money

**information**:

- how quickly sales are growing
- how the company is financing its growth
- whether it has taken on too much debt
- how efficiently it's collecting its accounts receivable
- how much profit it's making on its products and services

**trends**: financial health improving? declining?

**comparison**: with industrial peers

### Analyst Reports

**estimated earnings per share figures**

**less important**: ratings (conflict of interests, no "Sell" ever)

### Misinformation

NO hot tips
 
##Step 9: Evaluating Business
### Evaluating Business
1. determine how much the whole business is worth
  - assessing the company's financials in terms of per-share values to calcuate how much the proportional share of the business is worth

### Price and Quality

- P/E ratios
- return on equity
- cash-flow valuations

1. is this a strong and growing high-quality company?
2. is the company's stock priced attractively right now?

### Quality
- debt? cash?
- generating cash, spending efficiently?
- sales and earning growth?
- gross, operating and net profit margin growing?  
- managment competancy?
- competitors? brand name

### Price
Key metrics

- Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio
- Price-to-sales ratio
- PEG: compares the P/E ratio to the company's earnings growth rate

Evaluate price: estimate the company's earnings for all the years ahead and then discounting them to their present value

Stock price: a reflection of all its expected future earnings, discounted at an appropriate rate

### Value
1. focus on finding undervalued companies, paying close attention to a stock's price
2. focus more on the quality of the business
