#No Time for Design

##Research v.s. Decision Making
Project Cost = research cost + actual cost = trial & error cost + actual cost

+ add metrics and constraints to reduce potential risk
+ SMART Requirement
	+ what does tier-1 mean? 
		+ latency
		+ availability
		+ TPS

Data research
Research aspect of Design

## do options allow requirements to be met?
## what is potential cost of each option?
- change the requirement?
## what is additional cost if option is wrong?

More Design Research
## learn what came before
- who else is solving the same problem?
- how have other solved the problem
- any related CoE?
## Education
- Design Patterns / Prior Experience
- Available Technologies
- Books / Papers / Talks
## Verification
- Design Reviews

Excessive Research

* too much effort spent on researching cost and risk of a wrong decision

local minimal

cost of a wrong decision

When to perform more research

cheap local optima is enough clear "two way door"
- requirements met by multiple options
- minimal consequence of wrong decision
- minimal cost to change
more research desired
- uncertainties that may make or break selecting an option
- costly to change direction

deep research is critical clear "one way door"


- security review
- 


What are we solving - Customer First
- How is the customer going to use my service / product
- Create end-to-end use-case stories

Final Tips
- Design and Implementation can overlap 
 what design should be done first to unblock development
- Never too late to turn around if data shows it's desirable
 it may not be cost-effective, make sure it's data driven
- Consider Design Consultations and Reviews to be part of Research
 do them soon, do them often
- Consider Design Documents to never be complete
 80% done most of the time


Action Items (per project)
- Start from the customer (requirement)
- Establish initial requirements
- use "Wideband-Delphi" to estimate project duration and scope
- research design options to make good decisions
- utilize "PE Design Help"
- make sure research is sufficient but not excessive
- iterate and revisit decisions as needed
