#Knowledge Base#

Intent

This is my personal knowledge base. Hopefully this will help organize my learnings.

The knowledge base will be organized into different topics, as well as the notes taken while reading books in different fields. The intent of the note-taking would be:

1. Get a structural outline of the book, so that to help understand the topic;
2. By quoting key excerpts, make the notes as materials to review so no need to go back to the book unless details are needed.
