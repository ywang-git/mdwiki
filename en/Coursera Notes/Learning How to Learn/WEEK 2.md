# WEEK 2

## Chunking -- The Esentials

### Introduction to Chunking
Chunk: compact package of information

Illusions of competence in learning

Overlearning

Interleaving

### What is a Chunk

connect pieces of informaton / concepts together
fits in working memory

### How to Form a Chunk - Part 1

Pattern
join neuro mini chunks to large chunk

following a worked out solution

1. not only focus on individual steps
2. pay attention on higher level (surroundings)

best chunks are intuitive

### How to Form a Chunk - Part 2
mental ideas:

1. focus on undivided atention on the information you want to chunk
2. understand the basic idea
practice
first time you understand it is the time you can do it yourself
3. get a sense of big picture gaining context to see when to use the chunk (in addition to how to use it)

learning takes place in two ways

- bottom up: chunking (practice and repitition) 
- top down: big picture, what you're learning, where it fits in

context: where bottom up and top down meets (when to use certain technique)

picture walk through a chapter, structure chunks

### Illusions of Competence
the Importance of Recall
Mini-testing
Value of making mistakes

practicing and recall: the retrieval process help forming chunks
better than concept mapping
using recall of the key idea, not passive rereading

use highlight & underlining cautiously (it may give illusion that these concepts get into the brain)


recall your material outside of usual space / environment

## Seeing the Bigger Picture
### What motivates you?

Acetylcholine affects focused learning and attention

Dopamine signals in relation to unexpected rewards

Serotonin affects social life and risk taking behaviour

### The Value of a Library of Chunks

Value:
1. chunks can piece together in new and creative ways
2. chunk can be related to new field - "transfer"

Problem sovling

1. sequential step by step
2. holistic intuiation "global"

law of seredipity: lady luck favors the one who tries

### Overlearning, Choking, Einstellung, and Interleaving

do not overlearn (repeat practicing in one session)
overlearn may give illusion of competence
deliberate practice on difficult material

Einstellung (mindset) mind / neural pattern may prevent a better idea or solution from being found

Interleaving is important to decide when to use chunks of knowledge; to mix up your learning, relate different problem sovling skill and approach
